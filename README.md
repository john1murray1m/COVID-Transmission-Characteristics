This project uses SARS-CoV-2 transmission networks previously calculated (github files: https://github.com/john1murray1m/SARS-COV-2-Transmission-Networks),
with case data linked to the sequences within the transmission networks, to estimate the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Australia.
We calculate: the proportion of cases within each age group that occur from all other age groups; the distances between postcodes of each transmission pair;
and the proportion of transmissions that occur within each New South Wales Local Health District (LHD) from each other LHD.

The sequences used in these calculations are described in Murray et al., Journal of Infection, 2024.

Access to the case data requires approval from the Office of Health Protection, Australia Government Department of Health/ Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA)
Jurisdictional Executive Group (JEG).
